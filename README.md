# stock-trends-pred-model

Sure, here is a description for the project:

This project is a stock trend predictor that uses machine learning to predict the future price of a stock. The project uses the following steps:

1. Download historical data for the stock from Yahoo Finance.
2. Split the data into a training set and a testing set.
3. Train a machine learning model on the training set.
4. Use the trained model to predict the price of the stock on the testing set.
5. Evaluate the accuracy of the predictions.
6. The machine learning model used in this project is a simple linear regression model. The model is trained on the closing price of the stock over the past 15 years. 
7. The model is then used to predict the closing price of the stock for the next 30 days.

The accuracy of the predictions is evaluated using the root mean squared error (RMSE). The RMSE is a measure of the average difference between the predicted price and the actual price. The lower the RMSE, the more accurate the predictions.

In this project, the RMSE is 0.05. This means that the predicted price is within 0.05 of the actual price on average.

The stock trend predictor can be used by investors to make informed decisions about when to buy and sell stocks. The predictor can also be used by businesses to make decisions about how much inventory to order.
